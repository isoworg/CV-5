## Shannon Gamby

I am a recent graduate from Warwick University with a Masters degree (with honours) in Biomedical Science. I discovered the world of coding during my final year of University and realised that whilst working in research would satisfy my appetite for solving problems it would not satisfy my desire to create. Coding, however, does both of those things and is something I'm incredibly passionate about pursuing. The intensive course offered by Makers is an integral and exciting step towards becoming a professional software developer.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

**Masters (2016 – 2017)** During my Masters year I worked independently in Dr. Emma Anderson’s laboratory (University of Warwick) and focused on comparing the difference in HIV-1 and HIV-2 particle assembly. Throughout this year, as the project was largely student-led, I developed my ability to troubleshoot problems. With each experiment I carried out, I gained more experience with how to approach problems; I became better at asking specific questions when something wasn't working, I learnt when and how to ask for help, and was able to recognise when solutions I came up with in the past would work again. 

This aspect of my Masters - troubleshooting failing experiments - was what I enjoyed most, more so than the science itself... which is probably why I enjoy coding so much.

#### Adaptability

**URSS (July to August 2015)** In the summer of 2015 I put together a research proposal in order to be considered for a place on the Undergraduate Research Support Scheme (URSS) at the University of Warwick. I was awarded the grant and worked for 6 weeks in the laboratory of Dr. David Roper (University of Warwick) investigating specific protein domains in *Enterococcus faecalis* and their potential to be exploited as drug targets. 

Throughout this process I was mentored by PhD students but, due to circumstances outside of my control, I had to change mentors, and consequently projects, twice. This meant adapting not only to a new project with a different scientific background but also to a new team dynamic. I did this successfully, producing a poster on time and to an excellent standard for presentation at the International Conference for Undergraduate Research (ICUR). This entire experience really enhanced my teamworking skills and enabled me to develop my ability to adapt to ever-changing and fast-paced environments.
